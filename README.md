Twin Cities Code Camp
=====================

This is where I will put code, docs and information about any Twin Cities Code Camp presentations that I give.

You can get to the main Twin Cities Code Camp website [here](http://twincitiescodecamp.com/)

More info:
I have also given presentations at [MN Enterprise Mobile](http://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile/) about MvvmCross (a Xamarin framework) and Xamarin.Forms (another Xamarin framework) - you can find the code for those presentations/projects [here](https://github.com/ellisnet/MNEnterpriseMobile).

  - On October 4th 2014 I gave a presentation about Xamarin.Forms at Twin Cities Code Camp - click on the folder above for more information about that presentation, and the code I used, and *lots* of information about Xamarin.Forms.
  - (More presentations to follow, I hope)
