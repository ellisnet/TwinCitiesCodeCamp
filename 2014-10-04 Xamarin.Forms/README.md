Information about Xamarin.Forms
-------------------------------

  * Xamarin.Forms is a cross-platform framework that runs on top of [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/platform) - it allows the same shared code application to (be compiled to) run on iOS, Android and Windows Phone (with possible future support for Windows 10?). It is very important to know that a Xamarin.Forms application for any of these platforms is a **native application** - for each of the platforms, the shared code (and a platform-specific stub) is **compiled to native code** that looks the same to the device as an application that was programmed using the native tools (Xcode/Objective-C/Swift on iOS, Java/Android Studio on Android, .NET on Windows). Xamarin.Forms is not a web-based or hybrid solution or something like the Java-Runtime-Engine-write-once-run-poorly-everywhere "cross platform" platforms of the past.
  * With Xamarin.Forms, all code is written in C# and user-interfaces can (optionally) be written in the XAML mark up language from Microsoft; you can write platform-specific code, but the goal really is to have most of your code be cross-platform in the shared project.
  * The best and most up-to-date source of information about Xamarin.Forms is the [Xamarin documentation site](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/)
  * Xamarin.Forms is not open-source.  It is actually a series of (closed-source) libraries and templates from Xamarin, that can be manually added to your projects as [NuGet packages](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Forms/).  However, there is a growing number of open-source addins or plugins for Xamarin.Forms - especially those available in [Xamarin Forms Labs](https://github.com/XForms/Xamarin-Forms-Labs) - some really great stuff there.
  * Free videos about Xamarin.Forms - [here](http://blog.xamarin.com/webinar-recording-meet-xamarin.forms/) and  [here](http://blog.xamarin.com/video-xamarin-forms-over-90-code-re-use-and-access-to-native-features/)
  * As of 10/4/2014 there is an **awesome free book** available for Kindle from Amazon.com from programming legend Charles Petzold.  If you want to learn about Xamarin.Forms, [this is the place to start](http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Xamarin-Forms-Preview-Developer-Reference-ebook/dp/B00NXYJ8DK/). Seriously, stop reading and go get the book now.  The final version is expected Spring 2015, and will probably no longer be free at that point.
  * As of 10/4/2014 there is **another awesome free book** available from Falafel Consulting written by another programming legend, Jesse Liberty.  This book isn't entirely about Xamarin.Forms, but Xamarin.Forms is covered.  Get that book  [here](http://falafel.com/landing-pages/learning-xamarin-ebook-download).
  * There is also an excellent series of blog posts about Xamarin.Forms from Jesse Liberty - available [here](http://blog.falafel.com/author/jesse-liberty/) - look for posts from July 2014.
  * Really great **online magazine articles** about Xamarin.Forms by Wally McClure - available [here](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/09/01/xamarin-forms.aspx) and [here](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/09/01/simplifying-cross-platform-mobile-app-dev.aspx)
  * There are some great blog posts from [James Montemagno about Xamarin.Forms](http://motzcod.es/)
  * There is always **a ton of exciting stuff** being anounced on Twitter about (hashtag) [#xamarinforms](https://twitter.com/hashtag/xamarinforms?f=realtime&src=hash) - check it out!
